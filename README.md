# Clustering task
Clustering is the task of partitioning the data points into _natural groups_ called clusters, such that points within a group are very similar, whereas points between different groups are as dissimilar as possible. Depending on the data and desired cluster characteristics, there are different types of clustering paradigms such as representative-based, hierarchical, density-based. Clustering is an unsupervised learning approach since it does not require a separate training dataset to learn the model parameters.

## About dataset
For our task, weâ€™ll choose a dataset concerning the <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lainguyn123/student-performance-factors'>student performance and contributing factors</a>. This dataset provides a comprehensive overview of various factors affecting student performance in exams. It includes information on study habits, attendance, parental involvement, and other aspects influencing academic success.

## Exploratory data analysis
We will analyze and visualize data to understand its key features, uncover patterns, and identify relationships between variables.

## Data preprocessing
We will transform raw data into an understandable and useful format.

## ML algorithms
We'll implement PCA to convert high-dimensional data into low-dimensional ones. After that, we'll compare the K-Means algorithm with the OPTICS algorithm to evaluate its performances.
