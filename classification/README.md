# Classification task
Classification is a supervised machine learning method where the model tries to predict the correct label of a given input data. The model is trained using the training data, and then it is evaluated on test data, before being used to perform prediction on new unseen data.

We'll deal with the classification task, implementing its simplest form known as binary classification which returns two discrete classes:
- 1 ("yes") the positive class
- 0 ("not") the negative class or.

A technique for solving a binary classification task is logistic regression.

## Logistic regression
It provides a probabilistic framework for understanding and predicting binary outcomes, making it invaluable in a variety of fields.
